        <h2>Every idea starts with a need</h2>
        <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

            <h3>Start with asking why</h3>
            <p>You will start seeing things differently and
                coming up with more effective ways of achieving
                goals.</p>

                    <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showingwork thatâ€™s not finished or doesnâ€™t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from
